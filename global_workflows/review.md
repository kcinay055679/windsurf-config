# Cascade Review Workflow

description: Fetches origin, compares current branch to default, and performs a comprehensive code review.

---

<step>
# 1. Fetch Latest Changes
Run the following command to ensure we have the latest history from the remote repository:
`git fetch origin`
</step>

<step>
# 2. Identify and Compare
1. Determine the name of the current branch.
2. Determine if the default branch is `main` or `master`.
3. Run a git diff command to compare the **current branch** against the **origin default branch**.
   - *Tip: Use `git diff origin/main...HEAD` (or master) to see only changes introduced in this branch.*
</step>

<step>
# 3. Analyze Changes
Read the output of the git diff. If the diff is empty, stop and inform the user that the branches are identical.
If there are changes, perform a **Deep Code Review** based on these criteria:

1.  **Logic & Correctness:** Are there potential bugs, infinite loops, or off-by-one errors?
2.  **Security:** Check for hardcoded secrets, SQL injection risks, or unvalidated inputs.
3.  **Performance:** Identify inefficient queries, heavy computations inside loops, or memory leaks.
4.  **Style & Standards:** Is the code readable? Are variable names clear? (Ignore minor formatting nitpicks).
    </step>

# 4. Present Results
Present the findings in this specific format:
